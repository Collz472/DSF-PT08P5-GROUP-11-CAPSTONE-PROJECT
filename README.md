# **ANALYZING AFRICA'S CONFLICT LANDSCAPE TO INFORM BUSINESS INVESTMENTS**
![Conflict](Images/Conflict_Image.png)

# **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**
Africa is highly marketable to multinationals due to its vast natural resources, growing consumer market, and expanding economic opportunities. However conflict and Political instability can lead to supply chain disruptions, regulatory hurdles, and heightened security expenses, making it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently. Using a structured data driven approach, this project used a data set from https://acleddata.com/about-acled/ to;
1. Investigate insights on key risk factors causing the conflict, event forecasting, conflict risk score, and risk classification.
2. Analyze the data set to identify conflict prone areas, forecast conflict areas, establish conflict score for countries, risk classification for different countries.
3. Perform statistical tests to understand which areas are prone to conflict, their risk scores, forecast areas in future likely to experience conflict and classify different types of conflict.
4. Provide actionable recommendations to multinationals on conflicts in Africa in terms of areas prone to conflicts and types of conflict so they can formulate good risk management strategies.

# **Problem Statement**
A UK based multinational organization (VMagic Leather Processing Factory) is interested in establishing a manufacturing plant in a location that is less prone to conflict and political instability. The organization has hired our data science consulting firm to analyze data for different countries in Africa and come up with a model that can accurately determine conflict hot spots, come up with a risk score, and forecast conflict events.

# **Objectives**
1. **Conflict Analysis in Africa**: Establish a foundational understanding of conflict types, high-risk regions, and underlying causes by analyzing relevant data.
   
2. **Dataset Exploration**: Gain familiarity with the datasetâ€™s structure, terminology, and quality by examining key variables, including numerical and categorical data.

3. **Business Insights for Site Selection**: Assist a multinational client in identifying conflict-free locations for a manufacturing facility by:
- Developing a predictive model to forecast conflict occurrences based on historical data and socio-political factors.
- Identifying key conflict drivers through correlation analysis of variables such as fatalities, disorder types, and actor involvement.
- Assessing spatial and temporal trends to understand conflict variations across regions and time periods.
- Evaluating conflict severity by predicting the likelihood of high-fatality events.
- Enhancing early warning systems through geographic risk assessments.
  
4. **Statistical and Predictive Analysis**
- Conduct descriptive and exploratory analysis using measures such as mean, median, variance, and frequency distribution.
- Perform correlation analysis to examine relationships between key variables.
- Apply hypothesis testing, including ANOVA, to compare disorder types across locations.
- Use predictive modeling techniques like logistic regression to assess conflict probabilities.
-Conduct trend analysis to visualize conflict patterns over time.

**Dataset Used**
This project used a data set from https://acleddata.com/about-acled/ a comprehensive repository of real-time data on political violence, protests, and other politically relevant events from around the world. The dataset is extensive with 413,948 rows and 31 features and is collected via a global network that aggregates reports from local, regional, and national media, government publications, and over 50 local data collection partners, covering more than 100 languages and updated on a weekly basis.
