    "Africa is highly marketable to multinationals due to its vast natural resources, growing consumer market, and expanding economic opportunities. However conflict and Political instability can lead to supply chain disruptions, regulatory hurdles, and heightened security expenses, making it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently. Additionally, conflicts often result in workforce displacement, financial volatility, and reputational risks.  Key Risk Factors regarding the conflict such as  event forecasting, conflict risk Score, conflict risk classification are key considerations that multinational organizations are going to be interested in when deciding which country to invest in and also when crafting their risk management strategies. This project will examine these factors using a structured data driven approach. We will use a data set from https://acleddata.com/about-acled/  . Using this data we shall;<br>\n",
    "        - Investigate insights on key risk factors causing the conflict, event forecasting, conflict risk score, and risk classification.<br>\n",
    "        - Analyze the data set to identify conflict prone areas, forecast conflict areas, establish conflict score for countries, risk classification for different countries.<br>\n",
    "        - Perform statistical tests to understand which areas are prone to conflict, their risk scores, forecast areas in future likely to experience conflict and classify different types of conflict.<br>\n",
    "        - Provide actionable recommendations to multinationals on conflicts in Africa in terms of areas prone to conflicts and types of conflict so they can formulate good risk management strategies.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size:16px; color:rgb(1, 1, 1);line-height: 1.8;\">\n",
    "Our data science consulting firm has been hired by a UK based multinational organization (VMagic Leather Processing Factory) that is interested in Africa. The mission of the firm is to establish a manufacturing plant in a location that is less prone to conflict and political instability. The company has tasked us to analyze data for different countries in Africa and come up with a model that is going to help them decide which country to invest in. Our goal is to formulate a model that can accurately determine conflict hot spots, come up with a risk score, and forecast conflict events.</p>\n",

    "In this project, we worked with the ACLED dataset—a comprehensive repository of real-time data on political violence, protests, and other politically relevant events from around the world. The dataset captures a wide array of details, including unique event identifiers, precise dates, event types and sub-types, information about the actors involved, geographic coordinates, and additional contextual attributes such as reported fatalities, tags, and sources. The raw data is collected via a global network that aggregates reports from local, regional, and national media, government publications, and over 50 local data collection partners, covering more than 100 languages and updated on a weekly basis. Data can be accessed through ACLED’s export tools, curated downloads, or an API, and is accompanied by comprehensive documentation that clearly defines each feature, ensuring analytical clarity\n",
    "The dataset is extensive with 413,948 rows and 31 features.<br>\n",

    "Furthermore, ACLED categorizes its events using a detailed classification system outlined in Table 2. This table presents the different event types, their associated sub-event types, and the overarching disorder categories. The event type provides a broad categorization—such as Battles or Protests—while the sub-event types offer more granular details (for example, distinguishing between an “Armed clash” and a “Government regains territory” within Battles). The disorder type further contextualizes the event by indicating whether it falls under political violence, demonstrations, or strategic developments. This structured taxonomy is essential for accurately analyzing conflict dynamics and understanding the nuanced nature of political violence.</p>\n",
